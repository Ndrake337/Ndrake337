### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Matheus

I'm a student of Computer Engineering in the 5th semester at SENAC, like 90% of the coders, I'm just a nerd guy that starts code because likes computer and games.

I like to think that I can be great in both, hardware and software, actually I'm more a software guy, but I also love work with some IOT code and stuff

Some things I'm doing at the moment:

- ðŸ”­ I'm working on full stack applications with Node Js, React and React Native, soon will be here on github. Also I'm using NodeMCU to create a smart plug extender with some collegues at college as my hardware project

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python beacause I want to study more about Artificial Inteligence, one of my biggers passions in tech

- ðŸ“« You can reach me using the email: matheus.felipe337@gmail.com
